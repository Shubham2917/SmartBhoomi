🌱 SmartBhoomi – User Dashboard

SmartBhoomi is a blockchain-powered web platform designed to bring farmers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers together on a transparent and trust-based network. It aims to eliminate middlemen exploitation, ensure fair pricing, and enable full traceability of agricultural produce from farm to consumer.

✅ Why SmartBhoomi?

In India and many countries, farmers face exploitation from middlemen and get low prices, while consumers pay high prices without knowing product authenticity. SmartBhoomi solves this by:

Fair Pricing – Farmers can sell directly to buyers at visible and fair rates.

Transparency & Trust – Every transaction is recorded on blockchain and is verifiable.

Accessibility – Lightweight platform for farmers with basic internet and smartphones.

Quality Assurance – Track freshness and prevent fraud or spoilage.

Inclusivity – Open for small and large farmers, retailers, and consumers.
