SmartBhoomi – Project Overview(SIH:2K25)

SmartBhoomi is an innovative platform designed to improve the Indian agricultural supply chain by empowering farmers, reducing the role of middlemen, and increasing transparency. This project was developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2025 with the goal of addressing real-world agricultural challenges using technology.

Key Features:
The platform includes a farmer management system that allows adding, updating, and deleting farmer details. It provides a dashboard for real-time data visualization and integrates blockchain technology to ensure transparent and secure transactions. The user interface is designed to be interactive and easy to navigate, with secure authentication and role-based access control for safety and convenience.

Project Structure:
The project contains the following major components:

The build folder for production-ready files.

The src folder for main source code files.

An index.html file as the main HTML template.

vite.config.ts for Vite configuration settings.

package.json for managing dependencies.

Live Demo:Your project is already using these technologies based on the screenshot and context:

React – Frontend framework

Vite – Build tool for fast development

TypeScript – Main programming language

CSS – Styling

Vercel – Deployment platform

To make the README more impressive and professional, we can add additional technologies and tools you are actually using or planning to use. Here are some good additions:

✅ Core Technologies:

React – Component-based UI development

Vite – Fast build and development server

TypeScript – Strongly typed JavaScript

HTML5 & CSS3 – Structure and styling

Node.js & npm – Package manager and scripts

✅ UI & Design:

Figma – UI/UX design reference

Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap (if you are using or planning to use a CSS framework)

✅ Backend (If applicable):

Supabase / Firebase (if you are using a database for farmer data)

Express.js (Node.js) (if you have a custom backend API)

✅ Security & Authentication:

JWT / OAuth (if implementing authentication)

✅ Blockchain (as mentioned in your project tasks):

Ethereum / Solidity / Web3.js (for blockchain-based transactions)

✅ Deployment:

Vercel – Hosting and deployment

GitHub Actions (if using CI/CD)

✅ Version Control:

Git & GitHub – Code management and collaboration
The application is deployed and can be accessed at:
https://smart-bhoomi.vercel.app

Technology Stack:
The frontend is developed using React with Vite as the build tool. The application uses TypeScript as the main programming language and CSS for styling. Deployment is handled via Vercel for fast and reliable hosting.
